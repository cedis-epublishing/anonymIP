About
-----
This plugin anonymizes IP addresses in the OJS database i.e. sets their last octet to zero before they are saved in the database.
If session_check_ip=Off, IP addresses in the sessions table will be anonymized as well. If session_check_ip=On, 
IP addresses in the sessions table will not be anonymized. In this case, it is recommanded to chose another means
of anonymizing or deleting these IP adresseses as soon as they are not needed anymore.
